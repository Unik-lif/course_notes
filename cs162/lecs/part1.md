# abstraction
## lec3:
Talk about process and thread.

Process: a restricted execution environment.

Threads: a single unique execution context

### Motivations for Threads
Operating systems must handle multiple things at once. (MTAO)
### Multiprocessing vs Multiprogramming
multiprocessing: multiple cpus. => parallel

multiprogramming: multiple jobs/processes. => time-slice likeï¼Œ but not parallel

parallelism: doing things simultaneously

concurrency is handling multiple things at once

so concurrency is a boarder concept than parallelism, parallelsim is sufficient to be concurrent.
