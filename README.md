## Notes taking procedure.
I am from UCAS, however my major isn't computer science.

Majoring in cyber-security, we don't have some hardcore courses that provide me the chance to develop our skills fully. These skills are so imporant for system guys.

[新专业开设第一年问题很大，大家懂得都懂，结果就是感觉自己啥都没学，代码完全不会写，纯背书考分，老师教啥就背啥，让干啥就干啥，从不课外用功，莫名其妙保研了，所以读研后用业余时间刷课，把基本能力捡起来]

I used to put my notes into my blog, but this will also cause a big problem, it decreases my blog's quality.

so I think it better for me to simply put a link in my blog without doing other weird things, .md will be stored in other reposity, so does code & labs & projects.

U can use these notes for sure, cause i am still a student. The persons you should really say thanks to are Professosrs.

I don't have much time spending on self-learning now, but I will take it simply as a game.

Courses I want to finish these days:
- 6.824 [MIT]
- cs188, cs162 [UCB]
- cs220 [KAIST]
- ysyx [NJU/UCAS]

Courses I've completely finished in my spare time: (not so much in fact, I should do my research)
- 18.01/18.02/18.06 [MIT] 
- - 每个人都学过，这个是给刷课热身用的，但我并不喜欢18.06，因为自己还是习惯看证明了
- cs61a/b/c [UCB]
- - 伯克利最基本的三件套
- 15213 [CMU]
- - 老生常谈
- csci0300 [Brown]
- - 配合CSAPP做的，有挑战性的课程，很清晰，做起来觉得很好玩
- rustlings & rCore [Tsinghua]
- - 比较成熟，反馈及时，就是开源版本的过于轮椅了，可能清华校内的版本会很有挑战性
- 6.s081 [MIT]
- - 相对来说比较标准，看代码和书籍收获很大，我也做了不少笔记
- cs50-AI [Harvard]
- - 真的是看论文纯摆烂的时候做的，一个项目做个一天就差不多了，但是很适合入门看起来

Books fully read and understood
- OSTEP [UWM]
- - In fact I read it with CS579 lectures
- CSAPP
- - I enjoy reading this book
- xv6 book
- - elegant
- OSPP I: Kernels & Processes
- - 其实写的非常好，xv6和OSTEP是偏hacky的书，但是OSPP展现的风格很系统
