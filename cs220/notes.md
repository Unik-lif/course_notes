## KAIST CS220 Crash
Rust benefits of Modern language:
- productive
- type-safe, functional, parallelism-friendly
- safe pointer programming


## Notes:
- Map is a lazy functional function.

- two kinds of crates: `lib.rs` or `main.rs`, for library form and binary form.

- The mod keyword declares modules, and Rust looks in a file with the same name as the module for the code that goes into that module.

- `or_insert_with` and `as_mut` is a very good tool.
