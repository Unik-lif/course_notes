## Lec1 neuro network
Perceptron: Forward Propagation

Neruo-like
- One output
- Multi output

Training for the weights
- learning rates
- design adaptive learning rate that adapts to the landscape

## Lec2 Deep Sequence Modeling
give us the foundation of the Deep Sequence Modeling -> LLM

Sequences in the Word

### Neurons with Recurrence
