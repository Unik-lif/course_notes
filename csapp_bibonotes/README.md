I am Link From Yueqing, Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province in China.

Basically I will do some digest for "old paper" mentioned in CSAPP.

I think A taste for the history is very critical if you want to know more.

So I will have fun here, Do this like reading novels.

The number in this directory basically in accord with the bibonotes in csapp, you can refer to the book to find out what the paper I am talking about.

To avoid being copied for some trash-like media like csdn in China, as well as practice my English, I will endeavor to make all the notes in English.
