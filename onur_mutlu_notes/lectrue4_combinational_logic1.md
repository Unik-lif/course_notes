## Fundementals

#### Q1：whats a computer?
1. computation
2. communication
3. Storage/Memory、

### this course will cover three pieces
1. processing
2. memory
3. I/O

###  combinational logic Design

#### Transistor:
MOS transistor: n-type and p-type

high-voltage --> open n-type mos

low-volage ---> open p-type mos

cmos: c: complementary.

#### Latency:

series will cause great latency.

#### Power Consumption
cmos is very efficent.
1. dynamic power consumption:$C * V^{2} * F$
    
    C = capacitance of the circuit(wires and gates)
    
    V = supply voltage
    
    f = charging frequency of the capacitor

    only counts when the dynamic state has changed.
2. Static Power consumption
   
   $V * I_{leakage}$

   supply voltage * leakage current

###  Moore's law
per 1.5 year, transistors doubles.

keep moore's law.

1. smaller transistors.
2. materials with better properties
3. optimizing the manufacturing steps.

### Assignment Part

#### Future computing Architectures.

Gain insights.
