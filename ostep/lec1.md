### background:
how computer works?

#### basic idea.
```
cpu <-> Mem

fetch decode execute
* get instructions from mem
* figure them out
* execute them

low-level -> C program level.

should know:

```
os: what is it?

os illusion for memory:

set boundary automatically for different programs, even if they look like that they use the same address of memory. So you don't need to worry about whether another program occupy the same address as your programs do.
