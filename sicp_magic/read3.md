chapter 2: building abstractions by combining data objects.

### The reason for compound procedures:
To elevate the conceptual level.

THe use of compound data leads to a real increase in the expressive power of our programming language.
```scheme
;consider the idea of forming a linear combination: ax + by
(define (linear-combination a b x y)
    (+ (* a x) (* b y))
)
(define (linear-combination a b x y)
    (add (mul a x) (mul b y))
)
```
One key idea in dealing with compound data is the notion of closure - that the glue we use for combining data objects should allow us to combine not only primitive data objects, but compound data objects as well.
